# solarSystemModel
A simple model of the Solar System.


To run the code you need install the `graphics` and `tkinter` libraries.

To solve the n-body problem, we first consider two bodies with masses m1 and m2, coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2,y2), and velocities (vx1, vy1) and (vx2,vy2):

To calculate the trajectory of motion of bodies, we use Newton's second law and the potential energy gradient:
