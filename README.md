# solarSystemModel
A simple model of the Solar System.


To run the code you need install the `graphics` and `tkinter` libraries.

To solve the n-body problem, we first consider two bodies with masses m1 and m2, coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2,y2), and velocities (vx1, vy1) and (vx2,vy2):

To calculate the trajectory of motion of bodies, we use Newton's second law and the potential energy gradient:

The potential energy for our case:

Acceleration of the first body on the OX-axis:

The Y-axis acceleration and the second body acceleration are calculated in the same way. Then we get:

The new velocities of each of the objects in a small time interval Î”t are calculated using the increment:

Similarly, we calculate the new coordinates:
