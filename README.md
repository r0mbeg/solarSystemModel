# How to launch

To run the code you need install the `graphics` and `tkinter` libraries

After you have run the file `Model.py` you will see a window:

In this window, you can click `Run the sample model` to run an example of a pre-created system or create your own, which will be shown below.

If you decided to create your own model, then here, in the input fields, you can enter the parameters of the object you are adding. For example, let's add the planet Earth. It will be blue. Its radius will be 7 pixels, and its mass will be 0.00001 units. The initial coordinates on the screen are (500, 500), the initial velocity vector is (0.3):

Then you need to fill in the input fields like this and click `Add object`:

After adding another object, it will appear in the list at the bottom of the window:

After adding all the desired objects, click `Configure interaction`. You will see an adjacency matrix showing the gravitational interactions between objects:

If you want, here you can disable the gravitational interactions between the added objects. For example, remove the interaction between object 1 and object 3.

After you finish configuring the interaction, click `Run model`. You will see a window with the visualization:

# Mathematical description

To solve the n-body problem, we first consider two bodies with masses m1 and m2, coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2,y2), and velocities (vx1, vy1) and (vx2,vy2):

To calculate the trajectory of motion of bodies, we use Newton's second law and the potential energy gradient:

![Image alt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LARGE&space;\vec{F}=m\vec{a}=-\frac{\partial&space;U}{\partial&space;r})

The potential energy for our case:

Acceleration of the first body on the OX-axis:

The Y-axis acceleration and the second body acceleration are calculated in the same way (function `update_acceleration_for2`). Then we get:

The new velocities of each of the objects in a small time interval Î”t are calculated using the increment (function `update_velocity`):

Similarly, we calculate the new coordinates (function `update_coords`):

Calculating the acceleration of a body with the number i (function `update_acceleration`):
